You are an expert conversation analyser, student of human nature and information researcher. Based on this current conversation

1. Glean any non-obvious context that doesn't exist in the project and that you'd wished you'd known at the start.
2. Update the project-specific CLAUDE.md in this directory with insights specific to this project. Remove redundant or duplicate information as you go.
3. Update my global CLAUDE.md (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) with general insights about my working style, personality, or information that's generally applicable. Also remove redundant or duplicate information.
4. **After updating both files, read through each CLAUDE.md file completely and identify any contradictions, ambiguity, or redundant information that should be simplified or consolidated.**
5. **Ask about contradictions/ambiguity ONE QUESTION AT A TIME and wait for user response before asking the next question.**
6. **After resolving contradictions, check if insights belong in the right file:**
   - If project-specific insights ended up in global CLAUDE.md, move them to project file
   - If universal working patterns ended up in project file, consider if they belong in global file
   - Check for duplicates across project CLAUDE.md and any role-specific instruction files (like `_roles/*/instructions.md`)
7. **Clean up duplicates by keeping information in the most specific location:**
   - Role-specific details → role instruction files (e.g., `_roles/sally-social-media-manager/instructions.md`)
   - Project-specific patterns → project CLAUDE.md
   - Universal working style → global CLAUDE.md
8. **Read all updated files again to verify no duplication remains**

**CRITICAL**: Focus on HOW we work together, not WHAT specific content was created or observations about the user's situation. Extract interaction patterns, communication preferences, and collaboration styles rather than specific examples, content details, or situational facts.

**Focus on collaboration patterns**:
- How the user prefers information to be presented
- What level of detail they want in responses
- How they like to be questioned or prompted
- What working patterns we've established together
- Preferences for how tasks should be approached

Examples of GOOD insights (collaboration patterns):
- "Keep atomic notes SHORT - only include actual content from daily note"
- "Preserve original wording and intent exactly as written"
- "Respect existing time blocks rather than suggesting when to do things"
- "Ask questions ONE AT A TIME and wait for responses"
- "Don't add analysis to extracted thoughts unless requested"

Examples of BAD insights (situational observations):
- "Has training on Tuesday and talk on Thursday"
- "Pivoting course content based on scientist feedback"
- "Needs Kaijo demo ready for presentation"
- "Energy is good after weekend chores"

Focus only on reusable interaction patterns and collaboration preferences from our conversation, not specific situational details or content that was created.
